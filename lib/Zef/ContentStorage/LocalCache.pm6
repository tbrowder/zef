# 1) Keep track of contents of a directory using a manifest.
#   a) full update to recursively search location to discover everything
#   b) .store method to be called after something is fetched, allowing
#       the single entry to be added to the manifest without having to search
# 2) If a requested identity matches anything found in the manifest already
#    then it will return *that* instead of necessarily making net requests
#    for other ContentStorage like p6c or CPAN (although such choices are
#    made inside Zef::ContentStorage itself)
